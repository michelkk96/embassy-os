# Dependencies

Define a service's dependencies once in `startos/dependencies.ts`. Each base requirement is packed into the service's manifest and published in its registry metadata. StartOS records required base requirements as current dependencies during initialization; runtime requirements refine them and activate optional integrations.

## Declare the Base Requirement

```typescript
import { sdk } from './sdk'
import { i18n } from './i18n'

const bitcoin = sdk.Dependency.required('bitcoind', {
  description: i18n('Needed for blockchain data'),
  metadata: { title: 'Bitcoin', icon: 'https://example.com/bitcoin-icon.png' },
  versionRange: '>=28.4:17',
  kind: 'running',
  healthChecks: ['bitcoind'],
})

export const dependencies = sdk.Dependencies.of().addDependency(bitcoin)
```

Pass `dependencies` to `buildManifest(versionGraph, sdkManifest, dependencies)` in `startos/index.ts` and to `sdk.setupInit(..., dependencies, ...)` in `startos/init/index.ts`.

The base is serializable at pack time, without effects: every dependency needs a description (which may be `null`), inline title and icon, version range, kind, and health checks when `kind` is `running`. Write `'*'` when any version is accepted. Name multi-flavor dependencies generically: for `bitcoind`, use **Bitcoin**, not Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Knots. The base is the loosest requirement the service accepts in any configuration.

A range is compared against the installed version and any versions declared in the dependency's `satisfies` list. One declared version must satisfy a complete `&&` conjunction; `||` branches may match different declared versions. Negated ranges and `!=` veto a matching branch.

## Optional and Conditional Dependencies

An optional dependency needs an `enabled` function. It appears among current dependencies when enabled and the runtime requirements are published. Required dependencies appear from the manifest even when the init script does not publish runtime requirements.

```typescript
const lightning = sdk.Dependency.optional('lnd', {
  description: i18n('Lightning backend'),
  metadata: { title: 'LND', icon: 'https://example.com/lnd-icon.png' },
  versionRange: '>=0.20:0',
  kind: 'exists',
  enabled: async ({ effects }) => (await config.read(c => c.backend).const(effects)) === 'lnd',
}).withDynamicNarrowing(async ({ effects }) => ((await config.read(c => c.features).const(effects)).advanced ? { versionRange: '>=0.21:0', kind: 'running', healthChecks: ['lnd'] } : null))
```

A dynamic range is intersected with the base. A disjoint range throws; a broader range cannot loosen the published requirement. StartOS applies the same base when an enabled optional dependency is reported through `effects.setDependencies`, including its running status and health checks. `kind` may tighten from `exists` to `running`, and health checks may only be added. Returning `null` keeps the base. `.const(effects)` makes `enabled`, narrowing, and `withInit` reactive, and each has its own effects context. A watched change in `enabled` reruns only `enabled`: the runtime requirements are republished when its result changes, and enabling the dependency reruns its narrowing and init handlers. A watched change in the narrowing republishes the requirements when the result changes. A watched change in a `.withInit` handler reruns only that handler.

Both required and optional dependencies can use `.withInit` to create cross-service tasks. Chain multiple `.withInit` calls to add handlers in order. Handlers run only while the dependency is enabled, after the combined runtime requirements are published. While an optional dependency is disabled, StartOS keeps the tasks the service created on it but hides them, and a critical one does not prevent the service from starting. They return when the dependency is enabled again.

```typescript
const bitcoin = sdk.Dependency.required('bitcoind', {
  description: i18n('Blockchain data'),
  metadata: { title: 'Bitcoin', icon: 'https://example.com/bitcoin-icon.png' },
  versionRange: '>=28.4:17',
  kind: 'running',
  healthChecks: ['bitcoind'],
}).withInit(async effects => {
  await sdk.action.createTask(effects, 'bitcoind', someAction, 'critical', {
    input: {
      kind: 'partial',
      accept: [
        {
          /* matching input */
        },
      ],
      set: {
        /* prefill */
      },
    },
    when: { condition: 'input-not-matches', once: false },
    reason: i18n('Configure Bitcoin for this service'),
  })
})
```

See [Tasks](tasks.md) for action input matching and replay IDs. Importing another package's action or types requires adding its repo to `package.json` and using `"overrides": { "@start9labs/start-sdk": "$@start9labs/start-sdk" }` to avoid a second SDK copy.

StartOS reports unsatisfied runtime dependencies, but their declaration does not prevent the service from starting. If the service cannot operate until a dependency is ready, handle that in `setupMain` and surface its own status or retry. To check the runtime requirements in an action or main, call `dependencies.check(effects)`.

## Reaching a Dependency

Resolve its live address with `sdk.host.getBridgeAddress`, as described in [Service-to-Service Networking](service-to-service.md). For a volume mount, use `.mountDependency({ dependencyId, volumeId, subpath, mountpoint, readonly: true })` in the `Mounts` chain. A missing dependency volume makes the mount fail.

The normal init order is `restoreInit -> versionGraph -> setInterfaces -> actions -> dependencies -> setup`. Put `actions` before `dependencies` when `withInit` creates tasks for registered actions.
