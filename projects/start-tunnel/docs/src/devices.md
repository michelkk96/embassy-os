# Devices

Every device on a StartTunnel subnet gets its own WireGuard configuration. Devices come in two kinds, listed in separate tables on the `Devices` page:

- **Servers** — a StartOS server that may configure the gateway on its own behalf: injecting DNS records for its private domains and auto-publishing ports (via PCP/UPnP). Both capabilities are on by default for a Server.
- **Clients** — a plain peer such as a phone or laptop that uses the tunnel for connectivity only, with no gateway-configuration abilities.

## Adding a Device

1. In StartTunnel, navigate to `Devices` and click **Add** — on the **Servers** table for a StartOS box, or on the **Clients** table for a phone or laptop. Which button you click sets the device's kind (there is no kind selector in the form).

1. Fill out the form:
   - Give the device a name (e.g. "Start9 Server", "Phone", "Laptop").
   - Select a subnet (the default is fine).
   - Accept or choose an IP address on the subnet (the default is fine).
   - Optionally set the [outbound IP](#outbound-ip) — the WAN address the device's traffic leaves from.
   - For a Server, **Allow DNS injection** and **Allow auto-publish** are enabled by default; uncheck either to withhold that capability. A Client has neither.
   - Click "Save".

1. Download the resulting `start-tunnel.conf` (or copy to your clipboard).

1. Import the config into the appropriate app on the device:
   - **StartOS server**: Navigate to `System > Gateways`, click "Add", name the gateway (e.g. "StartTunnel"), upload or paste the config, and click "Save". StartOS will now see the VPS as a gateway, and each service interface will automatically acquire new addresses corresponding to it.
   - **Phone or tablet**: Scan the QR code shown in StartTunnel using the [WireGuard app](https://www.wireguard.com/install/).
   - **Laptop or desktop**: Download the config and import it into the [WireGuard app](https://www.wireguard.com/install/).

> [!NOTE]
> The config's `Endpoint` — the address the device connects to — is the device's [outbound IP](#outbound-ip) if one is assigned (otherwise its subnet's); with neither assigned, StartTunnel uses the address you are accessing it over. The server answers on all of its addresses, so configs generated earlier keep working if you change these later.

## Server capabilities

A Server has two independently-toggleable capabilities, shown as switches in the Servers table:

- **DNS injection** — lets the server manage the DNS records StartTunnel serves for your private domains (see [DNS Records](/start-tunnel/dns-records.html)).
- **Auto-publish** — lets the server publish its own ports via PCP/UPnP (see [Published Ports](/start-tunnel/published-ports.html)).

Only enable these for servers you trust. Clients have neither capability.

## Changing a device's role

Use a device's actions menu to **Change to Server** or **Change to Client**. Changing to Server turns both Server capabilities on; changing to Client turns them off and moves the device to the Clients table.

## Outbound IP

By default a device's outbound traffic leaves from its subnet's [outbound IP](/start-tunnel/subnets.html#outbound-ip). On a VPS with more than one public IPv4 address, you can override this per device with the **WAN IP** field in the device's Add/Edit dialog — choose **Subnet default** to inherit the subnet's setting (the address it resolves to is shown in parentheses), or a specific address to pin this device's egress. On a single-IP VPS there is only one choice, so leave it on **Subnet default**. To add another public IPv4 address to your VPS, see [IPv4](/start-tunnel/ipv4.html).

## IPv6

If a device's subnet carries an [IPv6 prefix](/start-tunnel/ipv6.html), the device gets its own stable, globally-routable IPv6 address, shown in the **IPv6** column of the Servers and Clients tables. The address is computed from the prefix and the device's tunnel IP, so it never changes. It is the address to use when opening a pinhole from the CLI or adding a manual **AAAA** record on the [DNS Records](/start-tunnel/dns-records.html) page.

## Removing a Device

1. Navigate to `Devices`, select the device, and click "Remove".
