# Changelog

All notable changes to the StartOS OS product are documented here. The format is
based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and StartOS
uses an [extended version](https://docs.start9.com) of semantic versioning.

Full per-release notes are published on the
[GitHub releases page](https://github.com/Start9Labs/start-technologies/releases). This
file tracks notable changes since the move to the monorepo.

## [0.4.0-beta.10]

### Added

- **IPv6 GUA exposure control.** On a service interface, an IPv6 global-unicast
  address (GUA) keeps the usual on/off toggle and adds a **Local / Public**
  dropdown in the access column. **Local** (the default) keeps it reachable on
  the local network only — traffic from outside the subnet is rejected;
  **Public** exposes it to the Internet and attempts an automatic gateway
  pinhole (PCP). The choice is carried by the address's `public` flag, so
  services selecting addresses for P2P see the correct reachability. A GUA on a
  StartOS-terminated SSL port is served by the host's own TLS listener; a port
  StartOS does not terminate is forwarded (DNAT) directly to the service
  container. IPv6 ULAs and IPv4 are unchanged.
- **DualStack public domains.** A public (clearnet) domain is now reachable over
  both IPv4 and IPv6 whenever its gateway has an IPv6 global-unicast address
  (GUA). StartOS advertises an `AAAA` target (the GUA) alongside the `A` target,
  opens an inbound IPv6 firewall pinhole for the domain's port (via PCP — v6 is
  NAT-free, so there is nothing to forward), and serves the domain on the GUA
  through its existing SNI-routed TLS listener. The bare GUA itself is not
  exposed — only traffic matching the domain by SNI is accepted — so an SSL
  domain needs no separate GUA WAN opt-in (a plaintext domain, which has no SNI
  to filter on, exposes the GUA the same way it exposes the WAN IPv4). The
  add-domain DNS check and the domain setup modal now verify and display both
  the `A`/IPv4 and `AAAA`/IPv6 records and reachability; IPv6 reachability is its
  own `net.gateway.check-port-v6` endpoint (separate from the IPv4
  `net.gateway.check-port`) so each family is probed independently.
- **`--force` on service start.** `start-cli package start <id> --force` (and the
  `package.start` RPC `force` flag) starts a service even when it has an unresolved
  critical task.
- **Automatic gateway configuration (#3306).** A StartOS server now opens its own public ports and publishes its private-domain DNS by talking to its gateway — a home router or a StartTunnel — instead of leaving it as a manual step.
  - **Automatic port forwarding.** When a public address needs a port open, StartOS opens it by speaking a port-control protocol to the gateway: PCP (RFC 6887) → NAT-PMP → UPnP IGD, in that order. Mappings are reference-counted and withdrawn when the address is disabled or deleted; each active mapping is renewed at about half its gateway-granted lease, well before it would expire, so a still-wanted forward is never dropped, and letting a mapping lapse (no further renewal) is itself a teardown path once an exposure goes away. A single shared `PortMapController` also answers reachability, so `check_port` skips the remote echo probe when an automatic mapping is already active and reports the gateway-assigned external IP directly. Port mapping is scoped to the gateway each exposure actually routes through (the interface's own subnet gateway), so the box never probes an unrelated LAN router. A port's forwards and mappings are driven only by the addresses advertised at that exact port — exposing an SSL address never opens its plaintext sibling.
  - **Private-domain DNS injection (RFC 2136).** When a private domain is enabled on a gateway, StartOS pushes an `A` record (domain → this host's IP on that subnet) to the gateway's DNS server via DNS UPDATE so LAN devices that don't use StartOS's resolver can still resolve it, and withdraws it on disable/delete. `check_dns` now verifies a private domain by resolving the specific FQDN against the LAN's DNS server(s) and confirming it returns one of this server's LAN addresses.
  - **PCP HOSTNAME extension (SNI demux).** SSL/TLS services can share a single external port (443) across many hostnames: the gateway demultiplexes inbound TLS by SNI. StartOS emits PCP HOSTNAME mappings for public-domain vhosts (PCP-only — NAT-PMP/UPnP can't demux), gated by a PCP ANNOUNCE capability probe so the option is only sent to gateways that understand it. The protocol is documented as an Internet-Draft (`rfcs/draft-start9-pcp-hostname`).
  - **PCP PORT_SET (RFC 7753).** A contiguous port range maps in a single PCP MAP instead of per-port sweeps.
  - **Per-gateway capability tracking, sharding, and backoff.** Each gateway's PCP/NAT-PMP/UPnP support (and the PCP HOSTNAME extension) is recorded on the gateway in the database — fed by periodic watcher probes and by the outcome of every mapping attempt — so a gateway that refuses a protocol stops being asked instead of paying a timeout per attempt (a yes is trusted for an hour, a no re-probed after five minutes). Mapping work is sharded per gateway interface, so one gateway's slow or absent answers never delay another gateway's mappings, and a mapping that keeps failing backs off exponentially (15 seconds, doubling to a 16-minute cap) rather than retrying on a fixed interval.
  - **In-place WireGuard gateway updates.** `start-cli net tunnel update <id> <config>` (and a per-gateway **Update config** UI action) re-issues a WireGuard config onto the existing interface without churning the gateway identity, so forwards and public/private domains keyed to it survive the swap — primarily to add a `DNS =` line to an existing config. The update path uses NetworkManager `Update2` + `Device.Reapply`, so updating the gateway carrying the request no longer drops its own transport. Because NetworkManager (≤ 1.52) strips WireGuard peer preshared-keys on `Reapply` even when they are passed to it explicitly, StartOS re-applies each peer's PSK straight to the kernel device (over stdin, never argv) after the reapply, so the tunnel keeps its shared secret.
  - **Best-effort HTTP→HTTPS redirect (IPv6).** When a service is publicly exposed on 443 over an IPv6 GUA, StartOS asks the gateway for an `80→443` redirect pinhole so plain `http://` auto-redirects to `https`. Over IPv4 no such map is requested — the upstream gateway (e.g. StartTunnel, which serves a port-80 redirect by default) handles it.
  - **Insecure exposures never reach the WAN.** A port is opened to the public internet (an IPv4 WAN forward, an IPv6 GUA pinhole/forward, or an upstream port-map) only when the exposure is itself secure — TLS on the wire or a self-securing protocol. A plaintext exposure can still reach the LAN over a gateway explicitly marked secure, but the WAN is treated as never secure regardless of the gateway's setting.
- **Private domains on StartTunnel gateways (ba5396f49).** Now that a StartTunnel proxies DNS per subnet, a private domain resolves for tunnel clients (their DNS forwards to this server, which answers with the gateway's tunnel address), so the UI no longer restricts the public/private domain picker to router gateways — all gateways can use it. The "DNS Server Config" guidance is now gateway-aware: for a tunnel gateway it instructs you to point the StartTunnel subnet's DNS at this server. The private-domain and clearnet setup dialogs also surface the automatic alternatives (enable DNS Injection for the device; automatic UPnP/NAT-PMP/PCP port forwarding) instead of describing only the manual paths.
- **`MultiHost.bindPortRange` backend (#3270).** Host support for reserving a contiguous TCP+UDP port range (2–500 ports) in one call, stored as a single `RangeBindInfo` record under `Host.binding_ranges` and installed as one nftables rule per chain (via `PortForward.count`). Intended for real-time / WebRTC servers (coturn, RTP, SIP). Backed by the new `bindRange` effect.
- **Package init progress reporting (#3323).** A service can stream progress during the install/update finalization phase via the new `setInitProgress` effect; the host nests it inside the install's finalization phase using the standard `FullProgress` wire format, and `setupInit` auto-reports one step per composed init handler.
- **Phased backup progress (#3250).** `serverInfo.statusInfo.backupProgress` now uses the standard `FullProgress` shape (matching update/install progress). `NamedProgress.progress` is generalized to `PhaseProgress` so a phase can carry sub-phases, and the new `setBackupProgress` effect lets a service container stream its own backup sub-progress.
- **Backup format v2 (#3289).** Backups are written to a new `StartOSBackupsV2` directory, and the backup report now includes per-package duration. The backup targets list shows the free space available on every drive and network folder so the user can confirm a backup will fit before starting it. When this server's pre-v2 `StartOSBackups/<server-id>` backup is present on the selected target, the UI additionally warns before backup, then confirms the format change (#3324, `backup.target.legacy-info` RPC). Once migrated, StartOS also helps remove the now-obsolete V1 data: after a backup completes, if the target still holds this server's V1 backup, a warning notification reminds the user it is no longer needed; and the backup-create page shows a **Delete old backup** action for any target holding this server's V1 backup — whether or not a new (V2) backup exists yet — removing only this server's old backup; other servers' backups and `StartOSBackupsV2` are untouched (`backup.target.delete-legacy` RPC). Deletion returns immediately — the backup is atomically moved to a hidden trash folder on the target — and its space is reclaimed by a background sweep that posts a notification when it finishes (unlinking a large backup can take hours on some filesystems); a backup started while reclamation is pending finishes it first, shown as a `Reclaiming Space` phase in the backup's progress. Deleting requires a confirmation, plus an extra confirmation when this server has no current (V2) backup on the target (so the user can't unknowingly delete their only backup). Legacy detection and deletion are scoped to the current server's ID, so a target shared by several servers no longer flags or removes another server's backup.
- **Direct cross-package action runs via `access` (#3267).** Action metadata gains an `access` field (`'public' | 'dependent' | 'user'`, default `'user'`) controlling who may invoke an action directly through `effects.action.run`. Public/dependent actions give dependents a direct path instead of only creating a task; direct runs still honor the action's `visibility` and `allowedStatuses`.
- **`input-not-matches` tasks accept multiple values (#3310).** `TaskInput` splits into `accept` (a list of acceptable partial inputs) and `set` (the value to prefill when none match); the cross-package critical-conflict guard fires only when the input conflicts with every `accept` entry. The host still accepts the legacy `{ value }` shape over the effects socket for s9pks built on the pre-2.0 SDK.
- **Service interfaces tab.** Service interfaces are promoted to a dedicated sidebar tab; the dashboard interfaces card and per-interface detail route are removed, sidebar nav labels are decoupled from route paths, and the tasks table is redesigned (action-first, service rendered as an icon).
- **Unified marketplace + brochure.** The in-OS marketplace and the public brochure now share `@start9labs/marketplace` components behind an `AbstractMarketplaceService` (the OS persists to patch-db, the brochure to localStorage), so both ship the identical detail/preview UI. The brochure app is ported into the workspace and auto-deployed to `marketplace.start9.com` on master. The registry-selection modal is replaced by an inline registry-select dropdown (switch/add/delete inline), and custom registries can now be added by bare domain (https default; http for `.onion`) (#3349). Empty categories are hidden (snapping back to "all" on a registry switch that empties the selection), category icons are refreshed for the current set, and a "Package a service" link sits beneath the sidebar categories.
- **Nested idmapped mounts (#3248).** StartOS gains syscall-based mount primitives (`open_tree`/`move_mount`/`fsopen`/`mount_setattr`) and a `start-container mount` path, wiring up the SDK's `idmap` field on volume/asset/dependency/backup mounts end-to-end. See [`../start-sdk/CHANGELOG.md`](../start-sdk/CHANGELOG.md) for the SDK-facing surface.
- **Raspberry Pi image hardening (#3249).** Vendor kernel bumped to 6.18.33+rpt with apt pins so `/boot` stays vendor-only, `earlycon` for first-boot diagnostics, a loop-safe self-diagnosing `init_resize`, and data-drive-only setup for pre-installed devices.
- **Graceful shutdown on external power events (#3319).** Two systemd pre-shutdown barrier units (`startos-shutdown.service` / `startos-restart.service`) call `start-cli server shutdown/restart` and wait for graceful container teardown, so externally-initiated shutdowns (UPS / `qm` / ACPI) tear services down cleanly. The shutdown/restart RPC gains an opt-in `wait` param.
- **iOS root-CA install via configuration profile (#3240).** A new endpoint serves an unsigned Apple Configuration Profile (`PayloadType com.apple.security.root`); iOS/iPadOS download links are UA-sniffed and routed to `.mobileconfig`, fixing the broken `.crt` install flow on iOS 26.5 Safari.
- **`diagnose-hang` capture script (#3236).** Captures startd runtime state entirely via `/proc` and basic tools (per-thread kernel stacks, fds/sockets, journal tail, dmesg, disk health, lxc status) when startd is unresponsive and `start-cli` can't help.
- **`lo` and `lxcbr0` treated as secure networks (#3297)** for insecure (plain-HTTP) traffic, since loopback and the container bridge never leave the host; an explicit secure setting still overrides the intrinsic default.
- **In-place 0.3.5.1 → 0.4.0 update path.** Updating the OS from 0.3.5.1 no longer
  requires syncing a whole root filesystem file-by-file — the step that grew
  flakier the more files a device had. StartOS 0.3.5.1's existing over-the-air
  updater instead receives a compact migration payload (the 0.4.0 base image plus
  a boot-time rewire) and the 0.4.0 initramfs converts the on-disk layout to the
  0.4.0 format on first boot. The data partition is preserved and the existing
  package/database migration runs afterward as before.

### Changed

- **Stable, predictable IPv6 address (EUI-64).** NetworkManager is set to derive
  each interface's IPv6 address from its MAC (modified EUI-64) with RFC 4941
  privacy extensions off. StartOS applies this to existing network connections
  on every boot, not just newly-created ones, so upgraded servers pick it up too.
  The server therefore keeps one stable global-unicast address (GUA) across
  reboots instead of the default rotating stable-privacy address, giving the
  GUA-based clearnet and public-domain features a predictable address to
  advertise (`AAAA`) and pinhole.
- **External ports 9050 and 9051 are no longer restricted (#3407).** The port
  allocator reserved 9050/9051 for the 0.3.x host Tor daemon, which no longer
  exists. Freeing 9050 lets the tor service bind its SOCKS proxy with
  `preferredExternalPort: 9050` (without exporting an interface), giving every
  service a stable, always-valid service-to-service address for Tor SOCKS on
  the internal bridge — `10.0.3.1:9050` — with no reactive watch on the tor
  package and therefore no dependent restarts when tor is installed, updated,
  or removed. 9051 (the old control port) is freed as well; 0.4.x tor uses a
  Unix control socket, so nothing binds it host-side.
- **The StartOS admin UI is now addressed like a regular service interface (#3387).**
  At the SDK/effects layer the server's own host is identified by the reserved
  package id `start-os`, host id `admin`, and interface id `admin-ui` (renamed
  from `startos-ui`) — no more `null`/`STARTOS` sentinels.
  `host_for`, the host RPC APIs, and the `getHostInfo` / `getServicePortForward` /
  `getServiceInterface` / `listServiceInterfaces` effects all resolve
  `start-os` to the server host, `start-os.startos` resolves like any package
  hostname, and the UI passes `start-os` wherever a package id is expected.
  Installing a package with the id `start-os` is rejected. The migration
  re-points the tor package's persisted hidden-service identity for the admin
  UI (`STARTOS`/`startos-ui` → `start-os`/`admin`), preserving the server's
  existing `.onion` address across the identity change.
- **SDK:** `PluginHostnameInfo.packageId` is required in the type — url plugins
  (e.g. tor) should export the StartOS UI's urls as `start-os`/`admin` instead of
  `packageId: null`. For backwards compatibility during the beta.10 transition,
  the host still accepts the legacy `packageId: null` (or an absent field) over
  the effects socket and maps it to `start-os`.
- **OS Logs and Kernel Logs moved into System settings.** The top-level Logs tab
  is removed; OS Logs and Kernel Logs are now entries at the bottom of the System
  menu.
- **Migrated `startos-backup-fs` into the monorepo** as the `start-os/backup-fs`
  workspace member (from the former `Start9Labs/start-fs` repo); it is no longer
  built as an external `cargo install --git` dependency.
- **Monorepo reorganization.** `start-os` is now the monorepo for all Start9
  products. The OS product moved into its own `start-os/` directory as a thin
  wrapper: the `startbox` and `start-container` entry points live in
  `src/bin/`, the admin UI and setup wizard in `web/`, and the container runtime
  in `container-runtime/`. Backend logic moved from the old `core/` crate to the
  shared `start-core` crate (`shared-libs/crates/start-core`); shared Angular
  libraries moved to `shared-libs/ts-modules`; the SDK to `start-sdk`; and the `patch-db`
  submodule to `shared-libs/crates/patch-db`. Builds now run against the root Cargo and
  Angular workspaces (`cargo build -p start-os`, web from `shared-libs/ts-modules`).
- **Firewall migrated from iptables to native nftables (5b9cf7313).** Every StartOS-managed rule now lives in a single `table ip startos` with stable comment tags for handle-based, idempotent teardown (per-forward DNAT/hairpin/masquerade, the FORWARD `policy drop`, lxcbr0 container-egress accept, and the mangle policy-routing marks). lxc-net and wg-quick keep their own iptables-nft rules in separate tables. The `nftables` package is added to dependencies.
- **Manifest capability flags split (#3271, #3275).** The misleading `nestedRuntime` flag is replaced by two independent capabilities: `userspaceFilesystems` (mounts `/dev/fuse` for fuse-overlayfs storage) and `virtualNetworking` (mounts `/dev/net/tun` for VPN / WireGuard / tun workloads). Both are device grants only — the service LXC already retains `CAP_NET_ADMIN` within its user namespace via the standard `userns.conf` include, so no capability machinery is needed (an earlier `lxc.cap.drop` snippet that was wrongly framed as "re-granting `CAP_NET_ADMIN`" — and actually dropped five caps that were otherwise kept — was removed). Hard rename — packages using `nestedRuntime` must republish.
- **Service-container memory isolation (#3304).** Every service container is placed in a `services.slice` opted into systemd-oomd PSI monitoring, capped at total RAM minus a fixed 1 GiB host reservation; `system.slice`/`user.slice` get `MemoryMin` floors. A burst of concurrent installs can no longer overcommit RAM and wedge the host.
- **Container-runtime RPC/action logging is gated behind a dev build (#3325)** — production builds no longer log full RPC inputs/responses (which can contain action secrets) to service logs.
- **Web platform upgraded to Angular 22, TypeScript 6, and Taiga UI 5.11**, with a unified, version-pinned Prettier config enforced in CI.
- **SDK 2.0.0** ships alongside this release (see [`../start-sdk/CHANGELOG.md`](../start-sdk/CHANGELOG.md)); StartOS 0.4.0-beta.10 is its minimum host version.
- Backup progress is surfaced as a dialog with a percentage rather than a notification.
- **Dialogs and alerts no longer steal focus when they open.** `tuiAutoFocus` is
  gone from every surface that used it — the shared prompt dialog, the refresh
  alert, the OS-update dialog, the marketplace package drawer, and the setup
  wizard's password page. On mobile, autofocusing raised the keyboard the
  instant the sheet appeared, on top of the dialog's own buttons.

### Fixed

- **Login rate limiter no longer degrades logins to one per 20 seconds (#3512).**
  The password-login throttle used a single process-wide counter that only ever
  incremented and never reset, so after three logins since boot the entire box
  was capped at one login per 20 seconds across all clients (UI, CLI, API) for
  the rest of uptime. The counter now resets once 20 seconds pass without a
  further accepted login attempt — and a rejected attempt no longer advances the
  window — so the limit is a genuine three-attempts-per-20-seconds window rather
  than a permanent cap.
- **DNS forwarder no longer wedges box-wide after an upstream blip (#3473).**
  After a WAN, tunnel, or DHCP event degraded the currently-configured upstream
  resolvers, container DNS could go dark for every service on the box — external
  lookups failing with `Temporary failure in name resolution` — until the
  upstreams recovered or the box was rebooted. The forwarder held a read lock on
  its upstream catalog across each upstream query (up to 30s) while the task
  installing new upstreams gave up after 10s and retried, starving the very
  update that would have replaced the dead upstreams. The resolver now snapshots
  the catalog and releases the lock before forwarding, and installs new upstreams
  by atomic swap — no lock wait, no timeout, no retry — so a pending upstream
  change always applies immediately. Forward queries also use a 5-second
  per-attempt upstream timeout (matching what container clients wait) rather than
  30 seconds, and names in the private `.startos`/`.embassy` zones that no
  running service claims are answered
  authoritatively (`NXDOMAIN`) instead of being forwarded to — and leaked at —
  upstream resolvers.
- **Enabling a public IPv4 address on an SSL service interface now opens the
  gateway port automatically.** Only a public _domain_ on an SSL-terminated port
  used to trigger automatic port forwarding (PCP/NAT-PMP/UPnP); turning on the
  bare public IPv4 left the port closed until it was forwarded by hand. StartOS
  now requests the pinhole for the SSL port the same way it already did for
  public domains and IPv6 GUAs, so a public IPv4 on an `addSsl` interface (the
  StartOS UI included) is reachable from the Internet without a manual forward.
- **Installer: "Preserve" selections that cannot keep your data are now refused instead of silently erasing the data drive.** During a USB install, choosing **Preserve** for a drive whose StartOS data pool lives on a _partition_ of the drive (the 0.3.x single-drive layout) while installing the OS to a _different_ drive fell through to creating a fresh, empty pool on the data drive — permanently destroying the data the user asked to keep, with no error. The installer now validates the preserve selection before writing anything and fails with an actionable error instead: a drive whose pool lives on a partition must be selected for **both** the OS drive and the data drive, and a drive whose pool spans the entire disk must be paired with a different OS drive. The setup wizard applies the same rules up front: when the selected drives cannot keep the data, the **StartOS Data Detected** dialog says why and disables **Preserve**, so an unpreservable selection is caught with guidance to fix it rather than surfacing as an error once the install is already under way.
- **IPv6 services exposed through a tunnel are now reachable, and outbound IPv6 no longer leaks around a gateway.** StartOS now applies the full IPv4 policy-routing layer to IPv6, including CONNMARK reply-routing: a reply to an inbound IPv6 connection that arrived over a tunnel — whether terminated on the host or DNAT'd to a service container — is pinned back out the interface it arrived on, so exposing a service over a StartTunnel's delegated IPv6 actually works. Previously those replies had no route back and were blackholed, so inbound IPv6 over a tunnel was dead. Outbound, the server's IPv6 default is now chosen by route metric exactly like IPv4, and leak prevention is per-gateway: an outbound gateway that is explicitly selected but can't carry IPv6 drops the server's IPv6 via a blackhole in that gateway's own routing table — so your real address never leaks out the ISP link — without blackholing the reply traffic that keeps inbound tunnel services working.
- **Updating a WireGuard gateway's config no longer drops its preshared key.** The in-place update path (`net tunnel update` / the **Update config** UI action, NetworkManager `Update2` + `Reapply`) persisted the interface private key but silently dropped each peer's preshared key, so a re-issued PSK-using tunnel failed its handshake and went dead (taking tunnel-routed DNS down with it). The peer secret is now flagged system-owned so the update persists it, and the settings (peer secrets inline) are passed to `Reapply` explicitly — an empty-dict `Reapply` still stripped the PSK from the _running_ device even with the profile persisted correctly, hanging all traffic through the tunnel (e.g. forwarded ports) until the next reboot.
- **Dev builds bricked by an empty persisted host id (#3387).** Builds between
  #3366 and #3387 persisted the server host's then-sentinel id (the empty
  string) in the admin UI interface's `addressInfo.hostId`, which strict
  deserialization rejects — every boot failed into the diagnostic UI. The
  server host now has a real id (`admin`) and the beta.10 migration rewrites
  the empty value.
- **Critical-task start gate is now enforced backend-side.** Starting a service with
  an unresolved critical task was previously blocked only in the web UI; the CLI and
  RPC bypassed it. `package.start` now rejects such a start unless `--force` is passed.
- **Split DNS for dual public/private domains (#3263).** A domain configured as both private (e.g. on Ethernet) and public (on a StartTunnel) is now served as private DNS to LAN clients, gated per-gateway in the resolver, instead of falling through to the upstream forwarder and hairpin-routing to the public VPS IP.
- **DNS `[::]:53` wildcard listener (#3346).** DNS listeners bind with `SO_REUSEPORT` so the dual-stack catch-all coexists with the per-address sockets; previously the catch-all's TCP bind failed with `EADDRINUSE` and was silently dropped.
- **Host address list renders instead of panicking (#3345)** — `start-cli` no longer hits `todo!()` displaying the server host address table.
- **Web server connections run in parallel with HTTP/2 adaptive window (#3328)**, fixing head-of-line stalls under load.
- **Logger writes moved off worker threads (#3259).** File/stderr log writes no longer hold a mutex across a blocking `stderr` write, which could park every tokio worker (and stall ports 80/443) if journald backpressured.
- **`create_task` self-deadlock during `setupInit` (#3273)** — a service calling `createOwnTask` with an `input-not-matches` trigger from its init handler no longer wedges in `updating`.
- **Replayed task state is preserved when the target service is unavailable (#3309)** — services running before shutdown no longer stay stopped after boot when a critical-severity task replays against a still-initializing dependency.
- **Stale mountpoints are reconciled before remount (#3314).** After a `SIGKILL` left kernel mounts in place, a same-boot restart now lazily unmounts the stale target instead of failing every service load with "already mounted".
- **`TMP_MOUNTS` self-deadlock on nested idmapped mounts** is avoided (5aee392a2).
- **Backups to a physical drive no longer intermittently fail with `could not load backup` (`NotFound`).** A temporary mount's teardown unmounted by path, so a stale detached unmount (e.g. from a `Drop`) could tear a drive down _after_ its shared `TMP_MOUNTS` slot had already been reused by a fresh mount at the same hashed path — and a concurrent operation loading `mount.backup-fs` off that drive then hit `ENOENT`. Teardown now runs under the per-mountpoint slot lock and unmounts only while the slot has no live guard, so it can't unmount a mount another operation just established. Surfaced by the periodic backup-target listing (backup page open) racing backup-fs loads on exFAT and BTRFS targets (#3498).
- **Unmountable partitions are skipped when listing backup targets (#3237)** instead of aborting the listing.
- **Bind-mount source directories are auto-created via recursive canonicalize** (d8ae7f199), and mount propagation is corrected (27322b4a9).
- **`/media/startos` ownership on migrated installs (#3311, #3312).** A migration repairs the stale `root:root` overlay entry so migrated nodes match fresh installs (`root:startos`), letting the `start9` SSH user browse package data without sudo.
- **CA fingerprint hex bytes are zero-padded**, with a `0.4.0-beta.10` repair migration for affected installs.
- **`.onion` (Tor) and `.local` (mDNS) are routed correctly through the host SOCKS proxy** (b5dec33cf), and reaching a `.onion` registry without Tor now reports a clear error ("the Tor service is not installed / not running") instead of a generic connection failure.
- **`NetService` is torn down synchronously on container destroy (#3285)**, and the nftables/policy-routing reconcile is made atomic, idempotent, and lock-free (daeee4f12, cebd6d703, 3ee50b0c3).
- **A service with no active bindings no longer wedges shutdown/restart indefinitely (#3350).** After #3285 moved network teardown into the awaited container-destroy path, a no-op `clear_bindings` emitted no patch-db revision, so the convergence wait blocked forever — stalling reboots for a service accessed only over Tor. The teardown now skips the wait when nothing changed.
- **Host `reboot`/`poweroff` now tears service containers down cleanly.** On an OS-level power-cycle, systemd stopped `lxc.service` (whose `ExecStop` is Debian's `lxc-containers stop`) and `lxc-monitord` _concurrently_ with the graceful-teardown hooks, killing each container before `startd`'s `Exit` RPC could stop it — a burst of `lxc-stop … is not running` / `Connection refused (os error 111)` and a stalled reboot. The teardown hooks (`startos-restart.service` / `startos-shutdown.service`) now order `After=lxc.service lxc-monitord.service`, so the LXC container-stop infrastructure stays up until the graceful teardown has finished. `Shutdown::execute` also skips its own `reboot`/`poweroff` when systemd is already performing the transition (and exits so systemd's stop of `startd.service` completes promptly). A power-cycle now tears containers down like `start-cli server restart`.
- **ACME issuance restored.** `async-acme` is re-pinned to keep its HTTP backend (#3342), and `ring` is installed as the process-default rustls provider so ACME cert acquisition no longer panics on the dual ring/aws-lc-rs build.
- **Union variant memory is isolated per row (#3337)**, disabled options render correctly in select dropdowns (#3229), and the per-row Wi-Fi overflow menu no longer disappears (#3243).
- **The redundant "Plugin:" prefix is dropped from interface plugin labels (#3349)** — the plugin address group already sits within a plugin section.
- **Login and CA-wizard UX cleanup (e86dcc242).** The login button uses an inline loading state that holds until navigation completes (replacing the global overlay loader) and is correctly centered; the CA wizard gets a solid card background, drops the redundant "Bookmark this page" step, and moves the "repeat on every device" caveat into a notification.
- **`fedimintd` → `fedimint-guardian`** package-ID rename is handled across all four `0.3.5.1`→`0.4.0` migration paths (2a806d8b8).
- **Allow non-ASCII characters in WiFi SSIDs (#3365).** Adding, connecting to, or
  removing a WiFi network whose SSID contains non-ASCII characters (e.g. an accented
  letter or a typographic apostrophe) no longer fails with "SSID may not have special
  characters". SSIDs are passed to NetworkManager as-is, and SSIDs containing a colon
  are now parsed correctly when listing connections. The WiFi passphrase still
  requires ASCII, as mandated by WPA.
- **Updates-tab progress circle vanishing during install finalization.** A
  package update marked the overall install progress complete right after the
  old version was uninstalled — before the new version's finalization/init
  progress (added with package init progress reporting, #3323) had run — so the
  Updates-tab loading circle snapped to full and then disappeared partway
  through "installing/finalizing". Overall progress now completes only once the
  package is fully installed, so the circle keeps tracking live finalization
  progress until the update finishes.
- **The UI no longer freezes after you enter your master password.** Creating a
  backup, restoring a backup, and changing your password each verified the
  password in the browser, via a _synchronous_ WASM Argon2id call on the main
  thread. At the parameters StartOS hashes with (64 MiB, t=3) that blocks the
  tab for seconds on a desktop and 20–25 seconds on a phone, where it reads as
  a hung browser; creating a backup onto a target whose existing backup used a
  different password ran it three times over. All three flows now let the server
  verify — which it already did on every one of these calls, natively, in
  milliseconds — and the argon2 WASM module is gone from the UI and
  setup-wizard entirely. A target whose existing backup was encrypted under a
  different password now comes back as the new `BackupPasswordMismatch` error
  kind, so the UI still knows to prompt for that original password rather than
  reporting the master password as wrong.
- **Backup password prompts no longer autocapitalize, and no longer look like a
  login to your password manager.** The shared prompt dialog sets
  `autocapitalize="off"`, so a mobile keyboard stops capitalizing the first
  character of a password you type into it, and it now submits through its own
  buttons (or Enter) instead of a `<form>` submit — a browser password manager
  saw that submit and offered to save your backup encryption password as a
  saved credential. The setup wizard's **Unlock Backup** prompt gets the same
  `autocapitalize` treatment.
- **A cancelled or failed package update now leaves the previous version
  running.** When an update is interrupted, StartOS restores the service's data to
  its pre-update state before restarting the old version, so the service comes back
  on the version it had. Previously the old version was started against the
  partially-migrated data and failed its downgrade migration with a "cannot
  migrate" error, leaving the service stuck until its container was rebuilt.
- **EFI system partitions are no longer listed as backup drives.** A GPT drive
  formatted on macOS or Windows (or a former boot drive) carries a small hidden
  EFI System Partition alongside its data partition, so the backup drive list
  showed the same physical drive twice — the second entry an unusable ~200 MB
  partition displayed as "0 GB". Partitions whose partition type marks them as
  an EFI System Partition are now skipped everywhere drives are listed (backup
  targets, setup-wizard drive lists, `start-cli disk list`), and a sub-gigabyte
  partition that does remain shows its capacity in MB instead of rounding down
  to "0 GB".

### Removed

- **Package `alerts` manifest field (BREAKING, #3333).** Packages can no longer define install / update / uninstall / restore / start / stop confirmation messages. StartOS stops reading and showing them; existing installs and old s9pks are unaffected (the field is ignored on load). Built-in confirmations for destructive actions are unchanged.
- **`nestedRuntime` manifest flag** — replaced by `userspaceFilesystems` / `virtualNetworking` (see _Changed_), with no compatibility alias.

### Security

- **TSIG-authenticated DNS UPDATE (#3306).** RFC 2136 injections are authenticated with TSIG (RFC 8945, HMAC-SHA256) keyed off a per-device key derived (HKDF-SHA256) from that device's WireGuard PSK, closing a forgery vector where any co-located service emitting from the server's tunnel IP could inject DNS.
- **Packages are blocked from port-mapping the gateway (#3306).** Only startd may send UPnP/NAT-PMP/PCP upstream; a dedicated nftables guard table drops these protocols when forwarded from any interface (LXC), so a service can't open ports on the upstream gateway.
- **Packages are blocked from talking DNS straight to the gateway.** The same guard table now drops DNS (udp/tcp 53) forwarded off the container bridge, so a service can't query a gateway or public resolver directly — its DNS goes through the OS resolver at `10.0.3.1:53`, same as every other lookup.
- **Dependency/advisory cleanup:** resolved Dependabot alerts across core, web, and container-runtime (#3301); migrated to hickory 0.26 to clear DNS RUSTSEC advisories (#3302); resolved forked-dep RUSTSEC advisories in tokio-tar and async-acme (#3303).
- **Password hashes and backup key material are no longer sent to the
  frontend.** `serverInfo.passwordHash` — the master password's argon2 hash —
  was replicated into the public database, so every authenticated client held
  offline-cracking material for the master password. Separately, the backup
  metadata returned by `getBackupTargets`, `setup.cifs.verify`, and the disk
  listing carried each backup's `passwordHash` **and** its `wrappedKey`: the
  backup's encryption key sealed under that password, so a client could crack
  the hash offline and then unwrap the actual backup key. Both existed only to
  let the browser verify passwords locally, which it no longer does (see
  _Fixed_). `ServerInfo` drops the field entirely — the real hash stays in the
  private database — and the on-disk backup metadata is split from its public
  view, so the API returns only hostname, version, and timestamp. Existing
  servers are cleaned up automatically: startup deserializes the database
  through the typed model, which drops the removed key.
