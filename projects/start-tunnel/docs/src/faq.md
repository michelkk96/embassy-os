# FAQ

Answers to common questions about StartTunnel's security model, compatibility, VPS requirements, and what happens if Start9 goes away.

## Can anyone else see my traffic?

No. Published ports operate at Layer 3/4 (iptables DNAT), meaning the VPS rewrites IP headers and forwards packets without inspecting payloads. If your service uses HTTPS, TLS terminates at the service itself — the VPS never sees plaintext. For VPN traffic between devices, WireGuard provides end-to-end encryption. Since you own the VPS, there is no third party in the data path.

## Do I need a WireGuard client on my devices?

Only for private access — phones, laptops, and other devices connecting to your server over the VPN. For clearnet hosting (exposing ports to the public Internet), no WireGuard client is needed on the devices accessing your services.

## Why can't my Android phone resolve `.local` addresses while the tunnel is on?

Because Android never performs mDNS on a VPN. A `.local` name is an mDNS name: no DNS server resolves it — your phone resolves it by multicasting on the local network, and Android [excludes VPN connections from `.local` resolution](https://source.android.com/docs/core/ota/modular-system/dns-resolver).

Every config StartTunnel generates (since 1.1.0) includes a `DNS =` line pointing at the tunnel's resolver. With that line in place, all name resolution moves to the tunnel while it's up: the `.local` query arrives at StartTunnel as ordinary DNS, StartTunnel has no record for it, and the upstream resolver answers NXDOMAIN. A config imported to your phone before then has no `DNS =` line, so its name resolution stays on Wi-Fi and `.local` keeps working — until you re-scan or re-import a freshly generated config. Only name resolution is affected either way; routing is untouched, which is why the device's LAN IP still works.

A connected StartOS server (0.4.0-beta.10 or later) fixes this automatically: it injects a DNS record for its own `.local` name into StartTunnel over the tunnel, so the name resolves through the tunnel's resolver — from anywhere the tunnel reaches, not just at home. This happens whenever the server's device has **DNS injection** enabled, which is the default for a Server (see [DNS Records](dns-records.md)); you normally don't need to do anything.

If DNS injection is turned off for that server, or the `.local` device isn't a StartOS server, add the record by hand instead. On the [DNS Records](dns-records.md) page, add an **A** record mapping the `.local` hostname to the device's LAN IP; this restores the pre-`DNS =` behavior, with traffic flowing directly over your local network while you're on it. A private domain is another option — like `.local`, its records are injected automatically and resolve from anywhere the tunnel does.

## Can I run other services on the same VPS?

No. StartTunnel manages its own firewall rules and disables UFW. It is designed to be the sole application on the VPS.

## Does StartTunnel work behind CGNAT?

Yes. WireGuard clients initiate outbound UDP connections, so CGNAT is not a problem for connecting devices to the VPN. Publishing ports still works because public traffic arrives at the VPS's public IP.

## What if I forget my password?

SSH into your VPS and run:

```
start-tunnel auth reset-password
```

## What if Start9 goes away?

StartTunnel keeps working. It is fully self-hosted with no dependency on Start9 infrastructure. There is no coordination server, no telemetry, and no phone-home. The binary runs entirely on your VPS.

## How do I remove StartTunnel?

StartTunnel is designed to run on a dedicated VPS. To remove it, simply destroy the VPS through your hosting provider. All WireGuard keys and configuration are stored on the VPS and will be removed with it.

## What VPS providers work with StartTunnel?

Any provider that offers Debian 13 with root access and a **dedicated public IPv4 address**. Common choices include Hetzner, DigitalOcean, Linode, Vultr, and OVH. Budget VPS providers (~$5/mo) work fine — StartTunnel has minimal resource requirements.

> [!WARNING]
> StartTunnel's IPv4 published ports (clearnet hosting) require a dedicated public IPv4 address. Shared IPv4 addresses (CGNAT, shared NAT, load-balanced IPs) will not work. Some budget providers and IPv6-only tiers do not include a dedicated IPv4 — confirm with your provider before purchasing.

Some providers (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Oracle Cloud, IONOS) have cloud-panel firewalls that block WireGuard (UDP 51820) by default. See [Installing — Cloud firewalls](installing.md#cloud-firewalls) for setup instructions.

## The installer says "No internet connectivity detected", but my network works

Some minimal or "Lite" VPS images ship without `ping` (and sometimes `curl`), which the installer uses to check connectivity. Without `ping`, that check misfires and the installer aborts with a misleading connectivity error. Install the base utilities over SSH, then re-run the installer:

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl iputils-ping
curl -sSL https://start9.com/start-tunnel/install.sh | sh
```

See [Installing — Minimal or "Lite" images](installing.md#minimal-or-lite-images).

## Does StartTunnel work on an IPv6-only VPS?

It isn't designed to. StartTunnel assumes a dedicated public IPv4 address; its IPv6 support gives the devices on a subnet their own global IPv6 addresses on top of that, rather than running the tunnel without IPv4. The VPN itself can come up over IPv6, so a device can still join and reach others through the VPS — but only from a network that has IPv6 (most carriers and home ISPs are dual-stack, though some are still IPv4-only). Clearnet hosting expects a public IPv4 too: IPv4 published ports require one, and while a device can also be published over IPv6 (see [IPv6](ipv6.md)), only visitors that themselves have IPv6 can reach it. For clearnet hosting that anyone can reach, choose a VPS with a dedicated public IPv4 address.

## Does StartTunnel provide DDoS protection?

No. Your VPS IP is exposed on published ports. Use your VPS provider's built-in DDoS protection, or place a CDN in front if needed. See the [Architecture](./architecture.md) page for a full comparison of trade-offs.
