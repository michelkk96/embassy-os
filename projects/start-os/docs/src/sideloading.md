# Sideloading

Sideloading lets you install a service from a `.s9pk` file without using any registry. This is useful when testing a service in development, installing a service that is not listed on any registry, running a [second copy of a service](faq.md#can-i-run-two-copies-of-the-same-service), or if you prefer to eliminate the Marketplace as a point of trust.

## How to Sideload

1. Click **Sideload** in the top navigation bar.

1. Click the drop area to select a `.s9pk` file from your file system, or simply drag and drop the file into the drop area.

When you sideload from the command line with `start-cli package install --sideload`, installation errors appear in the command's progress output. Very long messages are shortened safely to fit the progress stream.

## Obtaining `.s9pk` Files

A `.s9pk` file can be obtained in several ways:

- **From a developer** — A service developer may share `.s9pk` files directly via chat, email, or a download link.
- **From a GitHub release** — Many open source services publish `.s9pk` files as release assets on GitHub.
- **Build from source** — If the service is open source, you can clone its repository and build the `.s9pk` yourself. See the [Makefile Build System](/packaging/makefile.html) guide for instructions.
